            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and
            having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my
            days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my
            proceedings in my days.</p>
